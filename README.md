# RFID-Multifactor-Authentication-System-using-IOT
Implement a campus security solution where students and faculty use RFID tags to request access to various facilities, and IoT-enabled notifications allow administrators to approve or deny access through a mobile app, ensuring only authorized individuals can enter . Enabling secure multifactor authentication.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/794c0389-4834-4c12-972d-910fcd48fe1f)
This project proposes a campus security solution that leverages Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology and Internet of Things (IoT) protocols to control and monitor access to campus facilities. Each authorized student and faculty member is provided with an RFID tag, which is used to request entry at various access points. Upon an access request, the system sends an IoT-enabled notification to a mobile application, allowing campus administrators to remotely approve or deny the request in real time. This method introduces multifactor authentication, combining RFID and administrator approval to ensure that only authorized individuals gain entry. The solution enhances campus security through robust access control, real-time monitoring, and a centralized log of access events for auditing purposes. This approach demonstrates an innovative integration of RFID and IoT for improved safety and security management in educational institutions.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2659cec-3a21-40a9-92a8-718d2c00c03e)
Campus security is crucial for ensuring the safety of students, faculty, and staff. Traditional access control methods, like key cards or basic RFID systems, provide limited security, as they typically lack real-time monitoring and are vulnerable to unauthorized use if a tag or card is lost or stolen. As campuses become larger and more complex, there is a growing need for smarter, more flexible security solutions that can adapt to evolving security requirements.
This project aims to enhance campus security by implementing a system that combines RFID technology with Internet of Things (IoT) protocols. Each authorized individual is given an RFID tag to request access at designated entry points. When an access request is made, the system sends a notification to a mobile app used by campus administrators, allowing them to approve or deny access in real time. This approach provides a multifactor authentication layer, increasing security and enabling administrators to monitor and control access remotely. By integrating RFID and IoT, this solution provides a more secure, efficient, and responsive campus security system.
